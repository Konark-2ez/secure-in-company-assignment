//Mathematics 
/*
  The number of total combinations possible can be calculated by all the possible outcomes
  Dice A = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
  Dice B = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
  total possible outcomes = {
     {1,1},{1,2},{1,3},{1,4},{1,5},{1,6},
     {2,1},{2,2},{2,3},{2,4},{2,5},{2,6},
     {3,1},{3,2},{3,3},{3,4},{3,5},{3,6},
     {4,1},{4,2},{4,3},{4,4},{4,5},{4,6},
     {5,1},{5,2},{5,3},{5,4},{5,5},{5,6},
     {6,1},{6,2},{6,3},{6,4},{6,5},{6,6}
   }
   Therefore from the above possible outcomes we can calculate the total combinations to be 36
   i.e Number of faces in Dice A X Number of faces in Dice B = 36
